REQUIREMENTS
# Mini project on Scientific calculator
# This project implements various mathematical operations in C

#Introduction

1.Modern scientific calculators generally have many more features than a standard four or five-function calculator, and the feature set differs between manufacturers and models 

2.The defining features of a scientific calculator include:

      *Scientific notation
      *Floating-point arithmetic
      *Logarithmic functions, using both base 10 and base e
      *Trigonometric functions (some including hyperbolic trigonometry)
      *Exponential functions and roots beyond the square root
      *Quick access to constants such as pi and e
      
#Research    

1.A brief literature review indicated that whilst there was substantial literature on the use of calculators in mathematics lessons, little work had been done on the use of calculators in assessment.

2.Between the 2003 and the 2007 studies five countries displayed a significant increase in the usage of calculators in the Grade 4 classroom:
Armenia, Hong Kong, Latvia, Lithuania and the Russian Federation
